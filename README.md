# Education Inequality

Purpose: This project will address education opportunity inequality in U.S. high schools, specifically regarding average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams for college applications, in order to investigate whether performance is predicted by socioeconomic factors.

Data: This project will use two data sets - The first is EdGap_data.xlsx from EdGap.org in 2016, and contains data about average ACT scores, SAT scores, and socioeconomic characteristics for schools in several districts. The second data set is ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv is from the National Center for Educational Statistics https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp, and has more basic data about each of these schools.
